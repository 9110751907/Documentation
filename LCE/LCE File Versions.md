| 0033-0035 | The [offset](https://github.com/Team-Lodestone/Documentation/assets/60078656/ff3b60bf-bf5e-45e4-80bc-eacd8e5bb09f) to the index [may start in the middle of the index(?)](https://github.com/Team-Lodestone/Documentation/assets/60078656/277ab882-7aa9-4e42-b60b-e7b2b9d90756), there also [may be file data **inside** the index](https://github.com/Team-Lodestone/Documentation/assets/60078656/3384de41-9fb1-4f6d-a5b0-97258623912c), the [file count seems to be huge for some reason](https://github.com/Team-Lodestone/Documentation/assets/60078656/c41e79f7-2b29-4480-9058-bc0d15586ccb). |
| 0035 | First version to have the same savegame format used in the latest version (as of the writing of this documentation) |

Note: These tests were performed with an emulator, with one world generated per version.
THIS IS NOT FINISHED YET, SOME VERSIONS MAY BE MISSING.
Once this is finished, I will probably upload all of these worlds into a repo.
