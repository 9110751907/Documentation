### Notes
| TU(s) | Notes |
| :-:|:-:|
| 0033-0035 | This format differs from the one we see today, it has been documented [here](./Pre-Release%20Save%20Format.md) |
| 0054 | First version to have the same savegame format used in the latest version (as of the writing of this documentation) |

Note: These tests were performed with an emulator, with one world generated per version.
THIS IS NOT FINISHED YET, SOME VERSIONS MAY BE MISSING.
Once this is finished, I will probably upload all of these worlds into a repo.
